# Priorities

## Top 3
- **Accessibility**: Given our target audience, those that are in dire need, not everyone has a computer or a device that has advanced features
- **User efficiency**: Want it to be as fast and easy to use as possible. We want them to be in and out of the website, rather than browsing through the website. 
- Maintainability: Making sure the data is up to date with the data source because we don't want them to arrive at a shelter and turned away since they got inaccurate information 

## Why Accessbility and User Efficiency
- We believe that these are our top two priorities because we feel that when it comes to maintainability, we cannot control the data in the current scope of the project. If this was implmented in real life then we would make sure that the data is being updated by the source themselves to maintain current data. Accessibility is important because those who are homeless and low-income do not usually have the common technologies that others may have, so thinking about how they can access this platform is a priority to think about. User efficiency is also important because it is a platform that we don't want people to spend too much time on. We want them to be able to find the information they need quickly, and exit the platform.

## What We Are Designing
- Low-level overview: We will be developing a platform/website that will help those that are homeless and low-income to find a nearby food bank that is offering meals.
