# Plan

1. How will you coordinate your work?
    - Who will coordinate the work?
        - As our team’s Project Manager, Rachel will coordinate the work for our group.
    - What will their project management practices be?
        - Rachel will continue to send weekly agendas detailing our expected objectives to accomplish, with accompanying people responsible for doing so. Additionally, Rachel will check in with the team during our weekly meetings to ensure we are following our agenda, where we are in comparison to our proposed timeline, and if there are any blockers to be aware of.
    - Will you have meetings? How frequently? Who plans their agendas?
        - We have weekly meetings outside of class, and depending on need, schedule an additional meeting if our work was unable to be completed in our first meeting’s allotted time. Rachel plans the agendas for the meetings, and we start each meeting outlining what we will cover or work on during this time.
2. What tools will you use to communicate?
    - For each, articulate the alternatives and why that is the best choice.
        - We will use our slack group message as one of the primary resources to communicate with each other. This is the best choice for our team because we each check this regularly for class already, and can easily ask questions to our teacher and TA easily through this platform.
        - Another primary resource we use is zoom, in which we schedule regular weekly meetings (and more dependent on need). This platform is familiar to all of us, and allows us to articulate certain things better than simply typing out responses. Zoom allows us to share as similarly to an “in-person” meeting as can be during this time.
        - An alternative method we use to communicate is through each other’s phone numbers and sending text messages. We thought it useful to have a direct way to contact each other in the case that someone might have missed slack messages, or were having issues with seeing them on their phone while away from their computer.
3. Who will own components in your architecture?
    - Owning them means being responsible for writing them and making sure they are functional and correct.
    - For each component, list the one person who is in charge of getting it done.
        - Soham is going to build the “MealPrograms” model, because he can work closely with Rachel and Kevin who have adequate technical experience.
        - Kevin is going to build the .csv file from the Seattle dataset, because he has experience working with datasets. 
        - Robert is going to build the “Header” view, because this requires less technical ability and can be done individually. 
        - Kaitlyn is going to build the “About” view, because this requires less technical ability and can be done individually.
        - Rachel is going to build the “Find a meal” view, because this requires communication with other components and she can work closely with the CTO. 
        - Rachel is going to build the “Filtered results” view, because this requires communication with other components and she can work closely with the CTO.  
        - Kaitlyn is going to build the “Browse all” view, because this can more easily be built off of the filtered results view.
        - Robert is going to build the “Alert” view, because this requires less technical ability and can be done nearly individually. 
        - Kevin is going to build the “Map” view, because this requires knowledge of the Google Maps API, and he has experience using APIs. 
        - Robert is going to build the Filter “Go” button controller, because it works best with the timeline and he can work collaboratively with Rachel and Kevin. 
        - Soham is going to build the Selected address hyperlink controller, because he feels comfortable with . 
        - Kevin is going to build the Map controller, because he is building the Map view so he will be familiar with the functionality.
4. What is your timeline?
    - Include a list of milestones you'll reach and deadlines for each.

5. How will you verify that you've met your requirements?

    For the purposes of our project we believe we can verify our requirements through manual testing. The goal will be for the team to act as users and simulate user flows end to end, making sure that the expected results are achieved. Justification: Completing these user flows via manual testing is paramount to ensuring minimal gulfs of evaluation and execution, and the ability for our product to deliver what the user’s needs. 

    We will also be able to apply manual testing to our independent components making sure they function correctly and deliver the expected results. Justification: Manual testing of our independent components will be done to verify expected functionality within the system. (Ex. alerting when input is not valid)

    In addition to manual testing we will also review and inspect each other’s components, applying “fresh eyes” to make sure that proper syntax, validation, and functionality are present. Justification: People make mistakes, whether it be from lack of knowledge or fatigue. Having each team member inspect and review one another helps identify these errors and/or lapses, providing support and course correction so that the team can achieve success in the product. 

    Specific verification details can be found in the requirements document. Our verifications will be integrated into our process when the respective component is completed, as well as holistically when the product is near complete. 

To make a good plan, brainstorm disasters that might happen and test your plan against them. Illness, injury, API limitations, difficult to fix bugs: how resilient is your plan to all of these crises?
    
- Possible disasters:
    - Team member(s) get sick
    - Trouble with wifi
    - Trouble meeting over zoom/at a time that works for everyone
    - Family emergencies
    - Personal struggles
    - Issues using github
    - Issues using Google API
    - Difficulties working on code at the same time
    - Struggles with fixing bugs
    - Unable to complete all requirements on time
 
    - While life might get in the way or cause blockers, we need to anticipate all the possible struggles we may face in order to best overcome them if need be. This includes reaching out to our professor and TA when issues arise, and seeking help when our team feels we are stuck. Creating a clear channel of communication will let us get ahead of the problem we may be facing. Additionally, ensuring our plan can be made flexible in order to produce a MVP, minimum viable product, if we are unable to secure all the functionality and features we had anticipated. Conducting regular check-ins and usability tests may help our product to be more malleable and useful to users in the case that we experience a struggle/hardship as a team.
